### 🏗️ My Playground: Favorite Tech Stacks 🚀

I love building **innovative solutions** that push boundaries and bring ideas to life. Here’s what I play with the most:

* **⚡ NestJS** – For building scalable, maintainable backends with clean architecture.
* **🌐 Next.js** – For blazing-fast web apps and seamless SSR/SSG magic.
* **📱 Expo.js** – Crafting mobile experiences that just work, without the hassle.
* **🧠 PyTorch** – Making machines see, understand, and think (hello, computer vision!).
* **🎨 React.js** – Bringing interactive, beautiful UIs to life.

😂 **Fun Fact:** I’m the kind of developer who gets nervous when other devs are on **Windows**… nothing personal, I just like my terminal cozy and my builds drama-free. 💻✨
