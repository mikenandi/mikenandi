# Hi there, I am Michael Nandi

### I’m a developer who loves Jesus Christ and is passionate about building innovative computer vision solutions that transform lives across Africa. My mission is to use technology not just to push boundaries, but to create meaningful impact in people’s daily lives.

### 🏗️ My Playground: Favorite Tech Stacks 🚀

I love building **innovative solutions** that push boundaries and bring ideas to life. Here’s what I play with the most:

* **⚡ NestJS** – For building scalable, maintainable backends with clean architecture.
* **🌐 Next.js** – For blazing-fast web apps and seamless SSR/SSG magic.
* **📱 Expo.js** – Crafting mobile experiences that just work, without the hassle.
* **🧠 PyTorch** – Making machines see, understand, and think (hello, computer vision!).
* **🎨 React.js** – Bringing interactive, beautiful UIs to life.

🎉 Why I love it: I’m drawn to Facebook-originated tech like PyTorch and React Native because that’s where the innovators hang out—they give me the freedom to be creative, experiment wildly, and build the next big thing.

If you want, I can also make a **more visually playful version** with icons, badges, and emojis for each tech stack that really pops on GitHub. Do you want me to do that?
